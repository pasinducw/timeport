  - `models/session.py`: 100%
  - `models/time_entry.py`: 100%
  - `models/time_utils.py`: 100%
  - `models/client.py`: 92%
  - `models/project.py`: 91%
  - `models/tag.py`: 92%

- Core Services
  - `services/session_service.py`: 76%
  - `services/entry_service.py`: 65%

### Areas Needing Improvement

#### Routes (Medium to Low Coverage)
- `routes/session_routes.py`: 79%
- `routes/entry_routes.py`: 63%
- `routes/client_routes.py`: 38%
- `routes/project_routes.py`: 39%
- `routes/tag_routes.py`: 40%

#### Services (Low Coverage)
- `services/client_service.py`: 42%
- `services/project_service.py`: 45%
- `services/tag_service.py`: 41%

#### Utils
- `utils/validators.py`: 32%
- `utils/logging_config.py`: 92%

## Priority Areas for Test Improvement

1. Route Handlers
   - Client routes
   - Project routes
   - Tag routes

2. Services
   - Client service
   - Project service
   - Tag service

3. Validators
   - Input validation
   - Business rule validation

## Running Tests

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

This will:
- Run all tests
- Generate a terminal coverage report
- Create an HTML coverage report in `coverage_html/`

## Coverage Configuration

Coverage settings are configured in:
- `.coveragerc`: Coverage tool configuration
- `pytest.ini`: Test runner configuration

### Current Settings
- Branch coverage enabled
- HTML reports generated
- Excludes test files and virtual environment
- Ignores common boilerplate code

## Continuous Integration

Test coverage is part of our CI pipeline through GitHub Actions. The workflow:

1. Runs on every push to main and pull requests
2. Executes all tests with coverage reporting
3. Uploads coverage reports to Codecov
4. Generates and stores HTML coverage reports as artifacts

### Requirements
- All tests must pass
- Coverage must not decrease
- Critical paths must maintain >90% coverage

### Viewing Coverage Reports

Coverage reports can be accessed in several ways:
1. **Codecov Dashboard**: View detailed coverage analysis and trends
2. **GitHub Actions Artifacts**: Download HTML coverage reports from the Actions tab
3. **Pull Request Comments**: Codecov bot will comment with coverage changes

### Local Development

When developing locally, you can generate the same reports:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest

# View HTML report
open coverage_html/index.html
```

## Next Steps

1. Increase coverage of route handlers to at least 80%
2. Add integration tests for services
3. Improve validation coverage
4. Add end-to-end tests for critical flows
